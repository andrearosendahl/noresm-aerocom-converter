# noresm-aerocom-converter (NAC)
Small tool for converting [NorESM](https://www.noresm.org/) output for the use in [AeroTools and PyAerocom](https://github.com/metno/pyaerocom).

AeroTools is a model evaluation toolkit made by the Norwegian Meterological Institute, and is primarily used to evaluate airpollution models, like [EMEP](https://www.emep.int/). While supporting a handfull of modeldata formats, the main format is *Aerocom3* format.

NAC is a small tool -- part of AeroTools -- meant to make it easier to for climate reseachers at Norwegian Meterological Institute to use AeroTools, by making the conversion between their modeldata files and Aerocom3 data.
